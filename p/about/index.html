<h2 id="bio-">Bio </h2>
<p><img src="/media/sean_farrell.jpg" alt="Sean Farrell" align="left" /></p>
<p>I was born in Phoenix, Arizona, USA on the 17th of October 1982. My 
mother is German and my Father is US-American. This makes me 
German-American, American-German or whatever. </p>
<p>My parents decided to move to Toulouse, France as I was 1 year old. I 
grew up mostly in France. My parents divorced, as I was about 10 and my 
Father moved to Austin, Texas, USA. This had the result that I spent 
most of my summer vacations in Austin. </p>
<p>In the last years in Toulouse I started my first company. I was 
specialized in web-applications development. It was work along side 
school and so was not so much, but definitely a healthy pocket money. </p>
<p>I went to the <a href="http://dstoulouse.fr">German School of Toulouse</a> and graduated there in 2003. 
With my &quot;Abitur&quot; in the pocket I looked for a place in a 
&quot;Berufsakademie&quot; (University of Cooperative Education) in Germany. This 
decision was made, because the BA is a very practical oriented and I 
definitely did not want to waste my time with theoretical studies. </p>
<p>I ended up making my studies in Karlsruhe at the <a href="http://www.ba-karlsruhe.de">BA-Karlsruhe</a> and with 
the &quot;<a href="http://www.baw.de">Bundesanstalt für Wasserbau</a>&quot; (Federal Waterway Engineering and 
Research Institute). There I worked on different projects. I stated 
administrating a high performance cluster, that was used for Fluid 
Computational Dynamics (CFD). I finally worked on a chain of tools based 
abound the extension of <a href="http://wissrech.ins.uni-bonn.de/research/projects/NaSt3DGP/index.htm">NaSt3DGPF</a>, a CFD solver. For my <a href="/media/Sean_Farrell_Diploma_Thesis.pdf">Diploma Thesis</a> I 
wrote a fully fledged graphical editor, that was used to create CFD 
models for NaSt3DGPF. </p>
<p>The German government has the policy that every government agency has to 
reduce their manpower of 3% every year, if it makes sense or not. But on 
the other hand they have to have at least 5% of the jobs must be 
apprenticeships. So in the interview I was told: &quot;We can&#39;t employ you 
when you are done.&quot; That was fine with me. But it meant that I had to 
look for an other job. I ended up being employed by <a href="http://www.ferchau.de">Ferchau</a>, a temp 
agency that specialized in engineering. I stated working for <a href="http://www.siemens.de">Siemens</a> on 
the software <a href="https://www.automation.siemens.com/mcms/process-control-systems/en/distributed-control-system-simatic-pcs-7/simatic-pcs-7-system-components/engineering-system/pages/process-device-manager-pdm.aspx">SIMATIC PDM</a>. </p>
<p>I got employed by Siemens in April 2009 and continued working on SIAMTIC 
PDM. I specialized on compiler and virtual machine construction, 
especially for the EDDL. SIMATIC PDM finally shipped in the end of 2010. 
After internal reshuffling of people I ended up working on WinCC V11 for 
the <a href="http://www.industry.siemens.com/topics/global/en/tia-portal/pages/default.aspx">TIA Portal</a>. </p>
<p>After compleating the V11 and V12 versions of the TIA-Portal I joined 
development of the <a href="http://www.automation.siemens.com/mcms/process-control-systems/en/distributed-control-system-simatic-pcs-7/simatic-pcs-7-system-components/engineering-system/Pages/engineering-system.aspx">PCS7 CFC Editor</a> in mid 2012, where I am working on the 
CFC compiler. I am currently working on a feature for the 8.1 version, 
which I can&#39;t talk about yet.</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-the-name-rioki-">Origin of the Name Rioki </h2>
<p><img src="/media/ryoohki.png" alt="Rio-Oh-Ki" align="right" /></p>
<p>I used to be a extreme Anime fan. I gobbled up everything that resembled 
Anime. Now it is not as bad as it was then, but I am still a fan. </p>
<p>Well I needed a user name at some point. I liked Rio-Oh-Ki from Tenchi 
Muyo and though up Rioki as a similar sounding user name. </p>
<p>Rio-Oh-Ki is actually a space ship. But in its idle shape (most of the 
time) it is a bunny / cat creature that likes carrots. It can convert to 
the space ship form on demand; when ever need arises... </p>
